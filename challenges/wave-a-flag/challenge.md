# Wave a flag
Can you invoke help flags for a tool or binary? [This program](warm) has extraordinarily helpful information...

Hint 1: This program will only work in the webshell or another Linux computer.

Hint 2: Run this program by entering the following in the Terminal prompt: $ ./warm, but you'll first have to make it executable with $ chmod +x warm

Hint 3: -h and --help are the most common arguments to give to programs to get more information from them!

Hint 5: Not every program implements help features like -h and --help.
