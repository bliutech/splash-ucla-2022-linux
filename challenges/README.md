# Challenges
Within this folder are challenges allowing students to practice running Linux commands! To work on each challenge, open up the ```challenge.md``` in each challenge folder. There is a prompt that will provide a bit more guidance for each unique challenge but the general goal is to find a particular string with the general pattern of ```flag{unique_flag_here}```. Try to see how many you can do!

**Finish all the challenges?**
Check out the ```/resources``` folder to see some extra Linux practices, activities, and resources you can try!
